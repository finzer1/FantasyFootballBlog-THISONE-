# Welcome to my Blog! {#sec-welcome}

Welcome to my blog entitled, "Welcome To My Blog - An Introduction To My Fantasy Football Course".
This is my first blog post.

# About Me! {#sec-me}

  It's funny to think that I would have never thought about enrolling in a Fantasy Football class in college, but here I am! As a refresher, my name is Finley Jacobson, I have grown up in the Midwest my whole life, and if I'm lucky, after graduation, I will end up somewhere outside of the Midwest! As of right now, I am a senior at the University of Iowa, currently on track to obtain my degree in psychology (BS) and criminology (BA). Now I know what you're thinking: how exactly does one find themselves taking a Fantasy Football course as a psychology/criminology major? This course was recently designated as an upper-level option for psychology (BS) students. I saw this as an excellent opportunity to finally learn about Fantasy Football while also expanding my (very limited) knowledge of football.

# About This Blog! {#sec-about}

  In terms of the topics my blog articles will cover, they will include various subjects such as football, Fantasy football, players, statistics, coding, and more. In other words, the topics I will be evaluating will be relatively new and at times challenging. Regardless, I'm excited! I'm thrilled to have found the perfect excuse to expand my knowledge in various areas that I am unfamiliar with. Additionally, I'm excited/proud that I didn't allow myself to conform to gender stereotypes or otherwise restrict/limit myself from pursuing within a predominantly male-dominated realm of knowledge. As the only female in the course currently, I take it upon myself to accurately evaluate and interpret each topic over the course of the semester. With each blog article I post, I aim to make it better than the previous one. 
    Additionally, I like to think that my blog articles will have a unique element to them, being a female within a predominantly male-dominated realm of knowledge. Perhaps my blog articles can offer a somewhat female perspective, allowing my fellow female-identifying readers or newcomers to better understand specific perspectives/evaluations, or even providing an opportunity for male-identifying readers and others to gain a female perspective on assessments.
